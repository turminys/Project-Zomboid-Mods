*TODOS and Ideas*
Add failure conditions to apply shock and burn damage
 - If low electrical skill, then chance to damage the condition of the item, as well as apply a burn status from an electric shock. 
 - Correct the inventory model and world models for inverter
 - Review generator code to make inverter work like generator. Except it will need battery instead of gasoline for fuel.
  - Need to decide if battery can be repaired/repacked. May do so, but with diminishing returns. 

 - Statuses
  - Look into adding custom status , such as shock status instead of burn. maybe it affects endurance or something over time
